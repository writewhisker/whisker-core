This project continues under the MIT License, maintaining compatibility
with the original whisker project. The core library has always been MIT
licensed and remains so.

REPOSITORY ORGANIZATION
=======================

As of 2025, the whisker project has been reorganized under the writewhisker
GitHub organization to better separate concerns:

- whisker-core (this repository) - MIT Licensed
  Core Lua library for interactive fiction

- whisker-editor-web - AGPLv3 Licensed
  Visual web-based story editor
  https://github.com/writewhisker/whisker-editor-web

- whisker-editor-desktop - AGPLv3 Licensed
  Desktop story editor with Tauri
  https://github.com/writewhisker/whisker-editor-desktop

The original repository at https://github.com/jmspring/whisker remains
available for historical reference and is also MIT licensed.

WHY DIFFERENT LICENSES?
========================

- MIT for whisker-core: Encourages broad adoption and allows integration
  into commercial and open-source projects without restrictions.

- AGPLv3 for editors: Ensures that improvements to the visual editing
  tools are shared back with the community, especially for hosted/SaaS
  deployments.
