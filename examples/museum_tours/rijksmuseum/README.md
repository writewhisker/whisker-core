## 🎓 Content Quality

### Example Passage: The Night Watch

```markdown
# The Night Watch
## Rembrandt van Rijn, 1642

### Overview
Rembrandt's masterpiece *The Night Watch* is one of the most
famous paintings in the world...

### What You're Seeing
At first glance, you might think this is a nighttime scene—hence
the nickname "The Night Watch." But it's actually a daytime scene!
Centuries of varnish darkened the painting until its 1940s
restoration revealed Rembrandt's true intention...

### Key Details to Notice
- Captain Frans Banninck Cocq (center, in black with red sash)
- Notice his hand casting a shadow on his lieutenant's golden coat
- This shadow proves Rembrandt's mastery of light
- The mysterious girl in golden dress (left of center)
- Hidden dog at lower right
- 34 people total!

### Recent History
In 2019, the largest ever research and conservation project on
*The Night Watch* began, with restoration visible to museum
visitors...
```

**Every artwork** has this level of detail, engagement, and educational value.
