**Welcome to the whisker Tutorial!**

This interactive tutorial will teach you how to create interactive
fiction stories using the whisker engine.

You'll learn about:
• Basic story structure
• Variables and state management
• Conditional choices
• Lua scripting
• Multiple endings

Let's get started!

**Lesson 1: Basic Story Structure**

A whisker story is made up of three main components:

1. **Story** - The container for your entire narrative
2. **Passages** - Individual scenes or moments in your story
3. **Choices** - Links that connect passages together

Right now, you're reading a passage. The buttons you see below
are choices that will take you to different passages.

Let's practice navigating!

Each passage can have its own unique text and choices.

    id = "lesson1_b",
    content = [[
**Passage B**

You chose Passage B! This passage is different from Passage A.

In your own stories, you can create as many passages as you need
to tell your narrative. Stories can be linear (one path) or
branching (multiple paths).

**Lesson 2: Variables**

Variables let you track information throughout your story.
They can store numbers, text, or true/false values.

You can display variables in your text using double curly braces:
{{variable_name}}

For example, your current score is: **{{player_score}}**

Let's practice with variables!

Great job! Your score is now: **{{player_score}}**

Variables are perfect for tracking:
• Player statistics (health, score, inventory)
• Story state (which events happened)
• NPC relationships
• Game progress

Notice how the score persists as you navigate between passages?
That's the power of variables!

Choices can have conditions that determine whether they appear

player actions.

requirements!

This passage is reachable because its choice has no conditions.

Unconditional choices are useful for:

• "Go back" options

Conditional choices are useful for:
• Unlocking new areas after collecting items
• Skill-based options
• Story branches based on previous choices

**Lesson 4: Lua Scripting**

whisker lets you write Lua code to create complex game logic.
You can use scripting in two ways:

1. **on_enter** scripts - Run when entering a passage
2. **action** scripts - Run when selecting a choice

Scripts can:
• Perform calculations
• Modify multiple variables
• Generate random outcomes
• Create complex game mechanics

Let's try a simple dice roll!

    content = [[
**Dice Roll Result**

You rolled a: **{{dice_roll}}**

Your new score is: **{{player_score}}**

This demonstrates how scripts can create randomness and variety
in your stories. You can use similar techniques for:
• Combat systems
• Random events
• Procedural content
• Success/failure checks
