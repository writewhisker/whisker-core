You stand at the entrance of a dark cave. A cool breeze flows from within,
carrying the scent of moss and ancient stone.

Do you enter the cave?

You step into the darkness. As your eyes adjust, you see two passages:
one leads left, the other right.

The left passage glows with a faint blue light.
The right passage echoes with the sound of dripping water.

You follow the blue glow deeper into the cave. The light grows brighter
until you emerge into a vast chamber filled with glowing crystals.

In the center of the chamber, you find an ancient treasure chest!

**You've discovered the Crystal Cavern!**

*THE END*

You follow the sound of water into a narrow tunnel. The ground becomes
slippery and suddenly gives way beneath you!

You fall into an underground river and are swept away into the darkness.

**Game Over**

*THE END*

-- Passage 5: Walk Away
local away = Passage.new({
    id = "walk_away",
    content = [[
You decide the cave is too dangerous and walk away. Perhaps it's
better to live to explore another day.

**You've chosen safety over adventure.**

*THE END*
